This repo is home to notes & code that accompanies Part 2 of Aurelien Geron's "Hands-on ML with `Scikit-Learn`, `Keras` & `TF`" book. The book provides a comprehensive overview of data science, machine learning (with `scikit-learn`), and deep learning (with `tensorflow`).

The Book assumes you know close to nothing about machine learning. It uses production-ready Python frameworks such as:
* `Scikit-Learn`
* `Keras`
* `TensorFlow`
* 
The author favors a hands-on approach through a series of working examples and just a little bit of theory. Prerequesites:

* Some Python programming experience
* Familiarity with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
* A reasonable understanding of college-level math (calculus, probability, Linear Algebra, and statistics)
The first part of the book is mostly based on Scikit-Learn, while the 2nd part is using Keras/TensorFlow.
